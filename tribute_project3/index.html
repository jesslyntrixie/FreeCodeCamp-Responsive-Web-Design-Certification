        <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
        <p>    Elizabeth "Betty" Cooper is a main character on The CW's Riverdale. She is portrayed by Lili Reinhart.</p>

        <p>    Betty was a student at Riverdale High School and longtime best friend of Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Kevin Keller and Veronica Lodge. She is also a former River Vixen as well as an editor for the Register, with her mother. Betty is the youngest sibling to her sister, Polly and older half-brother, Charles Smith. Most recently, Betty has followed in her mother's footsteps of joining the Southside Serpents, alongside her then boyfriend, Jughead, making her the Serpent Queen to his King.</p>

        <p>    Betty would also find herself at the center of the Black Hood attacks after learning that she was his inspiration for cleansing the town of Riverdale of sinners after she gave a speech at the Jubilee. She would go on to have numerous conversations via phone calls with him as well as do his bidding in an attempt to protect her friends. It wouldn't be until much later that she'd discover that the Black Hood was her father, who she would then help imprison. </p>

        <p>    After uncovering the identity of the Auteur, Betty revealed to Jughead that she and Archie kissed during Hedwig, which caused the two to become distant and eventually breakup, with Betty leaving for Yale and Jughead leaving for Iowa. Betty went on to follow in her brother's footsteps and became a FBI trainee, which led to her being abducted by the Trash Bag Killer. </p>

        <p>Seven years later, Betty returned to Riverdale along with Veronica and Jughead after being summoned by Archie to take back the town from Hiram Lodge and his corruption. She helped Archie take back his house from the Ghoulies, during which they agreed to be friends with benefits, but they eventually broke it off after Polly went missing and Archie's unresolved feelings for Veronica re-manifested. While searching for Polly, Betty began investigating the Lonely Highway killings with Jughead and Tabitha, which ultimately led them to an inbred illegitimate clan of Blossoms who were living in the woods and murdering women, including Polly. After laying Polly to rest and graduating to an official FBI special agent, Betty and Archie begin pursuing a real romantic relationship. However, as they were about to consummate it, Betty received a phone call about a bomb planted by Hiram under Archie's bed, forcing the two to flee his house, but the bomb detonates before they can escape, resulting in both Archie and Betty developing powers. </p>
